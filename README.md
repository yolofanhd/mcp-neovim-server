# Neovim MCP Server

A proof of concept integration between Claude Desktop (or any client) and Neovim using Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the official neovim/node-client JavaScript library. This server leverages Vim's native text editing commands and workflows, which Claude already understands, to create a lightweight code or general purpose AI text assistance layer.

## Features

- Connects to your nvim instance if you expose a socket file, for example `--listen /tmp/nvim`, when starting nvim
- Views your current buffers
- Gets cursor location, mode, file name
- Runs vim commands and optionally shell commands through vim
- Can make edits using insert or replacement

## API

### Resources

- `nvim://session`: Current neovim text editor session
- `nvim://buffers`: List of all open buffers in the current Neovim session with metadata including modified status, syntax, and window IDs

### Tools
- **vim_buffer**
  - Current VIM text editor buffer with line numbers shown
  - Input `filename` (string)
  - Filename is ignored, returns a string of numbered lines with the current active buffer content
- **vim_command**
  - Send a command to VIM for navigation, spot editing, and line deletion
  - Input `command` (string)
  - Runs a vim command first passed through `nvim.replaceTermcodes`. Multiple commands will work if separated by newlines
  - On error, `'nvim:errmsg'` contents are returned 
- **vim_status**
  - Get the status of the VIM editor
  - Status contains cursor position, mode, filename, visual selection, window layout, current tab, marks, registers, and working directory
- **vim_edit**
  - Edit lines using insert, replace, or replaceAll in the VIM editor
  - Input `startLine` (number), `mode` (`"insert"` | `"replace"` | `"replaceAll"`), `lines` (string)
  - insert will insert lines at startLine
  - replace will replace lines starting at startLine
  - replaceAll will replace the entire buffer contents
- **vim_window**
  - Manipulate Neovim windows (split, vsplit, close, navigate)
  - Input `command` (string: "split", "vsplit", "only", "close", "wincmd h/j/k/l")
  - Allows window management operations
- **vim_mark**
  - Set a mark at a specific position
  - Input `mark` (string: a-z), `line` (number), `column` (number)
  - Sets named marks at specified positions
- **vim_register**
  - Set content of a register
  - Input `register` (string: a-z or "), `content` (string)
  - Manages register contents
- **vim_visual**
  - Make a visual selection
  - Input `startLine` (number), `startColumn` (number), `endLine` (number), `endColumn` (number)
  - Creates visual mode selections

Using this simple set of tools, Claude can peer into your neovim session to answer questions as well as make edits to the buffer.

## Limitations

- This is a quick proof of concept to experiment with Model Context Protocol. Use at your own risk.
- May not interact well with a custom neovim config!
- Error handling could be better.
- Sometimes Claude doesn't get the vim command input just right.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS`: Set to 'true' to enable shell command execution (e.g. `!ls`). Defaults to false for security.
- `NVIM_SOCKET_PATH`: Set to the path of your Neovim socket. Defaults to '/tmp/nvim' if not specified.

## Usage with Claude Desktop
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCP Neovim Server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-neovim-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS": "true",
        "NVIM_SOCKET_PATH": "/tmp/nvim"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
